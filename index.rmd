# R scripts
Scripts to read in files, and help format them. You will then add your code to plot these data at the bottom. 

If you have __dplyr__ or __tidyverse__ (which contains dplyr) installed, you should use the "_dplyr" version, which should make more sense to you as it is what you will have used in your R course. If you have time, it would be worth quickly installing this package, using ```install.packages("dplyr")```. If you have __dplyr__ installed, download and use:

[format_and_plot_dplyr.R](format_and_plot_dplyr.R)

If you don't have it and don't want to install it, then you can use this (which does the same thing, but in base R):

[format_and_plot.R](format_and_plot.R)

__Note:__ Both scripts make use of __ggplot2__. You don't have to use this, but it will make your life a lot easier if you do. If you don't already have it, you can use ```install.packages("ggplot2")``` to install it.
